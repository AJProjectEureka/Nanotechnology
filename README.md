<H1> Introduction: </H1>
<p>Hi Eurekans, this database has been set up to easily compile all the research papers that we have used before in our research (hence considered useful) into a neat little database. As seen in the folders, they are segregated into neat folders based on category. Do note that some papers are present in multiple folders as the fields covered overlap with more than just a singular field. Please note that some of these papers are confidential and cannot be shared. This also makes the database even more valuable as you would not be able to easily find some of these papers (unless you surf the Darknet). Thank you for your time, please read below along the guidelines and procedures to easily navigate “The Treasure Trove”.</p>

<H1> Rules: </H1>
<p> Do not share any of the papers without prior permission of the database IC’s (Ming Liang and Aloysius) </p>
<p> Do not edit any of the papers </p>
<p> You may download the papers for your reference, but again, please do not share the files </p>
<p> Do not create google docs within The Treasure Trove, we have a limited amount of space. Please create the docs in your own personal accounts. The Treasure Trove is ONLY for research papers </p>
<p> For requests of any of the procedures, please refer to the format below as this would aid in quickly acknowledging and acting on your requests </p>

<H1> Procedures: </H1>

<li> Email papers to the respective IC </li>
<li> After approval (via relevance tests), the paper will be added into The Treasure Trove </li>
<li> If research paper is deemed worthy for a new topic folder to be created, then it will be. Do include in your request if you believe a new folder should be added </li>
</ul>

<h3> Removing research papers: </h3>
<ul>
<li> Papers will only be removed if the theories they present have been substantially proven false, hence leading to a useless research paper </li>
<li> Please approach the database IC’s and provide your argument </li>
</ul>

<h3> Sharing research papers: </h3>
<ul>
<li> Approach the database IC’s and alert them of your wish to share research papers </li>
<li> Include who you are sharing with, for what purpose and which document you would be sharing in your request </li>
<li> If the document is not confidential, you will be granted permission, if not, you will be advised on other documents which may also suit your needs </li>

<H1>Tips & Tricks </H1>
<p> Google drive has a search bar located on the top of your screen in the main page. If you are searching on a 		particular topic, using that engine is a good place to start. If will search the database for any papers that matches 		your keywords. </p>

<H1>Final Note: </H1>
<p> The research papers come from a very wide array of topics and areas. Please use them as you please, observe the rules and procedures to make The Treasure Trove a friendly source of information for all of us to enjoy. Also note, you can use this for your PW or self-study if you wish. Thank you very much! </p>
